            <p>Making a fort is almost never a bad idea. They are fun to construct, play games in, watch a movie in, or making up an imaginary world in. It's perfect in the living room on a rainy day, and great for outside when it's nice.You might think forts are for young kids only but we think you'd be surprised at the fun that can be had with a fort.</p>

            <p>There's something amazing about learning new things. Almost everyone has something they love or know a lot about that someone else doesn't. Have everyone spend a little bit of time making an engaging presentation that you all can take turns spreading some knowledge with. You learn a little more about the people that you live with and you can gain some cool new knowledge too!</p>
